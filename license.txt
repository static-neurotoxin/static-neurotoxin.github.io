        LACK OF ANY SUITABILITY FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE LICENSE
        * There are many licenses, this one is mine.

This license grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to
use, copy, modify, and distribute this software in source code form for
non-commercial purposes in perpetuity. You may not use this source code
for any commercial purpose. This software is provided "as is" without warranty
and undoubtedly contains a great many bugs and "undocumented" features, and
quite likely will only cause your computer to emit bad smells, catch fire and
unexpectedly undergo rapid disassembly. You have been warned.

In the event that you ignore my warnings and attempt to actually USE this software,
there is no liability for loss of your time, patience, hair and any other resources.

My only requirement is that you leave this license intact and maintain a list of
contributors. Fixing a bug or two would be nice as well.

If you host this project online, the website should be posted with the best GeoCities
esthetic, using only HTML 3 or earlier, have an animated GIF of a spinning logo for
the project, a non-functional counter of website visitors stuck at 144, an under
construction disclaimer with a date at least two decades in the past and no client
side scripting. Failure to follow these guidelines will undoubtedly produce a better
webpage.

Failure to follow these guidelines is no fun and will revert all rights to the software
authors.

If you find this software useful, consider buying the software developers a butterscotch
pudding. Or better, donate to a good charity.

TLDR:
